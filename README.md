#### Editing
- `CE_PATH` is path to your Cheat Engine's source code (where it contains `cheatengine.lpi`) 
- `ban_to_sus` is mapping Cheat Engine's detected strings to some your own strings.
- `eng_to_greek` is mapping English characters to Greek characters.
- `.lfm` is lazarus form files (editing caption and hint strings.)
- `.po` and `.pot` is language files in Cheat Engine bin folder (editing msgid strings.)

#### TODO
- [ ] edit strings in pascal source code `.pas` files.
